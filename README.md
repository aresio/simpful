# simpful
A Python library for fuzzy logic reasoning, designed to provide a simple and lightweight API, as close as possible to natural language.
Simpful supports Mamdani and Sugeno reasoning of any order, parsing any complex fuzzy rules involving AND, OR, and NOT operators, using arbitrarily shaped fuzzy sets.
For more information on its usage, try out the example scripts in this repository or check our [online documentation](https://simpful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

`pip install simpful`

## Usage example 1: controlling a gas burner with a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system

This example shows how to specify the information about the linguistic variables, fuzzy sets, fuzzy rules, and input values to Simpful. The last line of code prints the result of the fuzzy reasoning.


```py
import simpful as sf

# A simple fuzzy model describing how the heating power of a gas burner depends on the oxygen supply.

FS = sf.FuzzySystem()

# Define a linguistic variable.
S_1 = sf.FuzzySet( points=[[0, 1.],  [1., 1.],  [1.5, 0]],          term="low_flow" )
S_2 = sf.FuzzySet( points=[[0.5, 0], [1.5, 1.], [2.5, 1], [3., 0]], term="medium_flow" )
S_3 = sf.FuzzySet( points=[[2., 0],  [2.5, 1.], [3., 1.]],          term="high_flow" )
FS.add_linguistic_variable("OXI", sf.LinguisticVariable( [S_1, S_2, S_3] ))

# Define consequents.
FS.set_crisp_output_value("LOW_POWER", 0)
FS.set_crisp_output_value("MEDIUM_POWER", 25)
FS.set_output_function("HIGH_FUN", "OXI**2")

# Define fuzzy rules.
RULE1 = "IF (OXI IS low_flow) THEN (POWER IS LOW_POWER)"
RULE2 = "IF (OXI IS medium_flow) THEN (POWER IS MEDIUM_POWER)"
RULE3 = "IF (NOT (OXI IS low_flow)) THEN (POWER IS HIGH_FUN)"
FS.add_rules([RULE1, RULE2, RULE3])

# Set antecedents values, perform Sugeno inference and print output values.
FS.set_variable("OXI", .51)
print (FS.Sugeno_inference(['POWER']))
```

## Usage example 2: tipping with a Mamdani fuzzy system 

This second example shows how to model a FIS using Mamdani inference. It also shows some facilities 
that make modeling more concise and clear: automatic Triangles (i.e., pre-baked linguistic variables 
with equally spaced triangular fuzzy sets) and the automatic detection of the inference method.

```py
from simpful import *

FS = FuzzySystem()

TLV = AutoTriangle(3, terms=['poor', 'average', 'good'], universe_of_discourse=[0,10])
FS.add_linguistic_variable("service", TLV)
FS.add_linguistic_variable("quality", TLV)

O1 = TriangleFuzzySet(0,0,13,   term="low")
O2 = TriangleFuzzySet(0,13,25,  term="medium")
O3 = TriangleFuzzySet(13,25,25, term="high")
FS.add_linguistic_variable("tip", LinguisticVariable([O1, O2, O3], universe_of_discourse=[0,25]))

FS.add_rules([
	"IF (quality IS poor) OR (service IS poor) THEN (tip IS low)",
	"IF (service IS average) THEN (tip IS medium)",
	"IF (quality IS good) OR (service IS good) THEN (tip IS high)"
	])

FS.set_variable("quality", 6.5) 
FS.set_variable("service", 9.8) 

tip = FS.inference()
```
